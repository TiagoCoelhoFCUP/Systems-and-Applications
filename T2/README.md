In this project we were tasked with creating a family tree management system using a user form.

The goal is to be able to, through the form as an interface:
<ul>
  <li> Show all information/relations a person </li> 
  <li> Add/remove people to the family tree </li>
  <li> Update a person's details in the family tree </li>
  <li> Add/remove/update a person's profile picture </li>
  <li> Add/remove a "Parent" relation between individuals </li>
  <li> Add/remove a "Brother" relation between individuals </li>
  <li> Add/remove a "Son" relation between individuals </li>
  <li> Add/remove a "Married to" relation betwwen individuals (Handle Divorces) </li>
  <li> Update a person's relations in the family tree </li>
</ul>

This form manipulates the entries on 3 different tables:

-> "Married With"
